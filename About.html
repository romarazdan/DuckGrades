        <h2>About DuckGrades</h2>
        <p>DuckGrades is a website dedicated to calculating your grade. It was developed by Jacob Wood, Christopher Horn, Anthony Pizzuto, and Roma Razdan. </p>
        <h3>How to Use DuckGrades</h3>
        <p>You use DuckGrades by creating categories, subcategories, and assignments. 
            To create a category, you simply name your category, and click the add category button. 
            Categories would be your individual courses, like CS-146 or CAL-105. 
            DuckGrades helpfully creates subcategories for you to add your assignments, every time you create a category. 
            Subcategory options include homework, quizzes, tests, midterms, finals, presentations, and groupwork. 
            Next, you must set the weights of a subcategory. If you don't want to use a subcategory, you can set its weight to zero. The total weight for each category must add up to 100!
            To set the weight, choose the category name from the drop down menu under Edit a Subcategory, and then choose which subcategory you are editing the weight of.
            After that, you type in the value of your subcategory weight, and hit the edit subcategory in category button.
            Next, you need to put in your assignment grades. You use the drop down menus to select which category and subcategory you are puttting your assignment in.
            Then, you name your assignment, and type in the grade for the assignment using the text inputs, and hit the add assignment button.
            Once you have set all of your categories, subcategories, you hit the submit button, and your grade is calculated!
        </p>
        <h3>How DuckGrades Calculates Your Average</h3>
        <p>DuckGrades calculates your grades by taking the average of all the assignments in each subcategory, multiplying each average by the weight of the subcategory, adding these new subcategory numbers together, and then dividing this number by the amount of categories.</p>
